To delete all occurrences of the word 'JUNK' from the delete_word.txt file and write down the commands used, you can follow these steps in Vim:

Open the delete_word.txt file in Vim by running vim delete_word.txt.

Use the command :%s/JUNK//g to delete all occurrences of the word 'JUNK'. This command searches for 'JUNK' in the entire file (%) and replaces it with nothing, effectively deleting it.

Navigate to the end of the file by pressing G.
